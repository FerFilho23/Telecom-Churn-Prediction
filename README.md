# Credit-Card-Defaults
This project analyzes the **Default of Credit Card Clients** dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, which contains demographic, financial, and behavioral data of **30,000 clients in Taiwan**. The goal is to build a **classification model** that predicts **whether a client will default** on their next payment.
